        <h1>About Jotto</h1>
        <p>Jotto is a two player word game in which each player attempts to guess that other player's word.
          Each player has to come up with a five-letter word without repeating characters. The players take
          turns guessing five-letter words. After a guess, the other player then says how many letters in the guess match 
          a unique letter in their word. This repeats until one of the players guesses their opponent's word. </p>
